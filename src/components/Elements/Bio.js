        <p className="bio">
          Full stack web developer using background in sports and technology to build more user intuitive experiences online. 
          <br />
          <br />
          I thrive in a team environment and have created three
          mobile-first web applications built to solve real world problems and
          keep the user engaged. Most recently, I worked on a team of five to
          develop a full stack online implementation of classic table top party
          game. Currently I am developing a full stack CRM application centered around a coffee shop and can't wait to show case more from this project.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm passionate about creating life-enhancing user experiences and
          collaborating with others to develop meaningful mobile and web
          applications. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my love of teamwork,
          problem-solving and new skills in a fast paced environment to build
          better experiences.
