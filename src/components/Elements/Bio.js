        <h2>About</h2>
        <p className="bio">
          Full stack web developer using background in sports and technology to
          build more user intuitive experiences online.
          <br />
          <br />
          I thrive in a team environment and have created three mobile-first web
          applications built to solve real world problems and keep the user
          engaged. Most recently, I worked on a team of five to develop a full
          stack online implementation of classic table top party game. Currently
          I am developing a full stack CRM application centered around a coffee
          shop and can't wait to show case more from this project.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm passionate about creating life-enhancing user experiences and
          collaborating with others to develop meaningful mobile and web
          applications. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my love of teamwork,
          problem-solving and new skills in a fast paced environment to build
          better experiences.
